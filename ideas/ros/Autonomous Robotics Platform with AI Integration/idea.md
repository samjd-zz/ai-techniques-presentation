# Feature Idea: Autonomous Robotics Platform with AI Integration

## Overview
An integrated ROS 2-based robotics platform for autonomous agents that combines computer vision, audio processing, motion control, and AI inference using MediaPipe and Whisper to create a complete perception-to-action pipeline on Linux-based robotic systems.

## Problem Statement
Robotics systems require a unified approach to handle multi-modal sensor input (vision, audio) with AI processing, coordinated motion control, and efficient command-line management. Current solutions lack integrated, Python-based implementations that combine these components with modern AI models on Linux platforms.

## Proposed Solution
Implement a modular ROS 2 ecosystem with specialized nodes for:
- **Vision Processing Node**: Real-time visual perception using MediaPipe for pose detection, hand gestures, and object recognition
- **Audio Processing Node**: Speech recognition and audio analysis using OpenAI's Whisper model for voice commands and environmental audio understanding
- **Motion Control Node**: Coordination of robotic actuators, kinematics, and trajectory planning
- **Command Interface**: Linux CLI tools for launching, monitoring, and orchestrating robotic processes
- **Integration Layer**: Central coordinator node managing inter-node communication and state synchronization

## Expected Benefits
- Unified perception and action framework for autonomous robots
- Enables voice-command driven robotics with visual feedback
- Leverages cutting-edge AI models (MediaPipe, Whisper) for intelligent behavior
- Provides research-grade flexibility for roboticists and AI practitioners
- Facilitates rapid prototyping of autonomous agents on commodity hardware

## Technical Considerations
- **Technology Stack**: ROS 2 (Humble/Iron), Python 3.10+, MediaPipe, OpenAI Whisper, NumPy, OpenCV
- **Architecture**: Distributed node-based microservices via ROS 2 DDS middleware
- **Linux Requirements**: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, systemd for process management, support for GPU acceleration (CUDA/ROCm)
- **AI Integration**: MediaPipe Python SDK for vision tasks, Whisper for speech-to-text with model caching
- **Real-time Constraints**: Message priorities and QoS policies for deterministic control loops
- **Scalability**: Support for multiple sensor streams and modular node composition

## Project System Integration
- **Perception Pipeline**: Camera input → MediaPipe processing → ROS 2 pose/detection topics
- **Audio Pipeline**: Microphone input → Whisper transcription → Intent parsing → ROS 2 command topics
- **Motion Pipeline**: Planning node receives targets → generates motion commands → actuator node execution
- **Orchestration**: CLI launcher aggregates logs, manages node lifecycle, provides system diagnostics
- **State Management**: Shared parameter server for configuration, dynamic reconfiguration support

## Initial Scope
### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-3)
- ROS 2 workspace setup with standard project layout
- Vision node: MediaPipe initialization, camera streaming, pose detection publishing
- Audio node: Whisper model loading, real-time transcription, command extraction
- Motion node: Placeholder actuator abstraction with trajectory publishing

### Phase 2: Integration (Weeks 4-6)
- Node interoperability and message passing validation
- Linux CLI launcher for process orchestration
- Configuration management system
- Basic logging and diagnostics

### Phase 3: Enhancement (Weeks 7-8)
- Performance optimization for real-time constraints
- Multi-sensor synchronization and fusion
- Advanced gesture recognition and voice command context awareness
- System monitoring dashboard
