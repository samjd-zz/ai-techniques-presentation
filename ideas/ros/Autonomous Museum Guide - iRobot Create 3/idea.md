# Feature Idea: Autonomous Art Gallery Guide & Cultural Curator Robot

## Overview
An autonomous AI-powered museum and art gallery guide built on the iRobot Create® 3 platform that navigates exhibition spaces, recognizes artworks through computer vision, provides engaging storytelling and historical context through voice interaction, detects visitor engagement levels to adapt presentations, and creates personalized tour experiences based on individual interests. The system combines autonomous navigation, computer vision for artwork recognition, voice-activated Q&A, emotion detection for engagement, and dynamic tour route planning.

## Problem Statement
Museums and art galleries face several challenges in visitor engagement and education:
- Limited tour guide availability and scalability (especially for smaller institutions)
- Fixed tour routes that don't adapt to individual visitor interests
- Difficulty engaging younger, tech-savvy audiences
- Need for multilingual support without hiring multiple guides
- High cost of docent training and staff for continuous coverage
- Inconsistent tour quality depending on guide knowledge and enthusiasm
- Lack of accessibility features for visitors with disabilities
- Missed opportunity to collect visitor interest data for exhibition planning
- Inability to provide 24/7 after-hours virtual tours or special events
- Challenge of making art accessible and engaging for visitors without art history backgrounds

Traditional human-guided tours are limited by availability, cost, and consistency, while audio guides lack interactivity and personalization.

## Proposed Solution
Implement an iRobot Create® 3-based autonomous museum guide with five integrated AI modules:

- **Artwork Recognition Module**: MediaPipe + custom computer vision to identify paintings, sculptures, and installations, retrieve detailed information from museum database, and position robot optimally for visitor viewing

- **Interactive Storytelling Module**: Whisper-powered voice interaction with LLM-generated engaging narratives about artworks, artists, historical context, and cultural significance, adapting complexity based on visitor age/interest

- **Visitor Engagement Detection Module**: MediaPipe facial analysis to detect visitor emotions (fascinated, bored, confused), dwell time tracking, and adaptive presentation speed to maximize engagement and learning

- **Personalized Tour Planning Module**: Creates custom tour routes based on visitor preferences (impressionism, modern art, specific artists), time constraints, and detected interests, optimizing path through gallery space

- **Augmented Storytelling Module**: Projects related images, artist photos, and contextual information on tablet display; plays relevant music from the period; even shows "creation process" animations for abstract works

## Expected Benefits
- **Scalable Tours**: One robot can conduct multiple tours daily, serving 100+ visitors per week
- **Personalized Experiences**: Each tour adapts to visitor interests and knowledge level
- **Engagement Boost**: Interactive AI increases visitor engagement by 60%+ compared to audio guides
- **Multilingual Support**: Serves international visitors in 10+ languages without additional staff
- **Accessibility**: Provides detailed descriptions for visually impaired visitors, adjusts speed for elderly visitors
- **Data Insights**: Tracks which artworks generate most interest for future exhibition planning
- **Cost Effective**: Reduces docent staffing needs while improving visitor satisfaction
- **Extended Hours**: Enables after-hours virtual tours or special robot-guided evening events
- **Educational Enhancement**: Makes art accessible to visitors without art history backgrounds
- **Viral Marketing**: Unique robot guide creates social media buzz and repeat visitation

## Technical Considerations
- **Platform**: iRobot Create® 3 with Raspberry Pi 4 or NVIDIA Jetson Nano
- **Technology Stack**: ROS 2 (Humble), Python 3.10+, MediaPipe, Whisper, LangChain, Computer Vision (CLIP/ViT)
- **Hardware Additions**:
  - USB camera for artwork recognition (high-res for detail capture)
  - USB microphone array for voice interaction
  - 12" tablet display for visual storytelling (mounted eye-level)
  - Small speaker for ambient period music
  - LED indicators for "friendly" robot personality
  - Battery extender for 8+ hour operation (full museum day)
- **Artwork Recognition**: CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) for zero-shot artwork identification
- **Content Database**: Museum artwork metadata (artist, period, medium, provenance, dimensions)
- **Navigation**: Gallery floor plans with artwork locations, dynamic crowd avoidance
- **Safety**: Create® 3 sensors + minimum distance from visitors and artwork (safety zones)
- **Accessibility**: Screen reader compatible, height-adjustable display, voice-only mode
- **Multilingual**: Support for English, French, Spanish, Mandarin, Japanese, Italian, German

## Project System Integration
- **Artwork Recognition Pipeline**: Camera → CLIP vision model → Museum database lookup → Artwork metadata + stories
- **Tour Navigation Pipeline**: Visitor preferences → Route planner → Navigation2 → Create® 3 → Position tracking
- **Engagement Pipeline**: Camera → MediaPipe face/emotion detection → Engagement scorer → Adaptive storyteller (simplify/elaborate/skip)
- **Voice Q&A Pipeline**: Mic array → Whisper STT → LangChain RAG (art history) → LLM → Story generator → TTS + tablet display
- **Storytelling Pipeline**: Artwork metadata → LLM narrative generation → Synchronized voice + visual display + period music

## Initial Scope
### Phase 1: Core Navigation & Recognition (Weeks 1-2)
- ROS 2 integration with iRobot Create® 3
- Navigation2 setup with gallery floor plan mapping
- Autonomous navigation between artwork stations
- CLIP-based artwork recognition (20+ artworks)
- Basic voice interaction (Whisper STT + simple responses)
- Tablet display for artwork details
- Safety zones around artworks and visitor collision avoidance

### Phase 2: Interactive Storytelling & Engagement (Weeks 3-4)
- LangChain RAG system with art history content (books, encyclopedias, artist biographies)
- Engaging narrative generation with LLM (GPT-4 or local model)
- MediaPipe engagement detection (facial emotions, attention tracking)
- Adaptive storytelling (adjust complexity, speed, detail level)
- Multilingual support (5 languages minimum)
- Period music integration (Classical for Renaissance, Jazz for 1920s works, etc.)
- Q&A capability ("Who was the artist?", "What does this symbolize?")

### Phase 3: Personalized Tours & Advanced Features (Weeks 5-6)
- Visitor preference intake via tablet or voice ("I love impressionism", "I have 30 minutes")
- Dynamic tour route planning with optimization algorithm
- Multi-visitor queue management (schedule tours, wait times)
- Gallery event integration (special exhibitions, artist talks)
- Social media photo opportunities (robot poses next to artwork with visitor)
- Visitor satisfaction feedback collection
- Museum analytics dashboard (popular artworks, tour completion rates)
- After-hours virtual tour capability (via live stream)
