# Product Requirements Document: Autonomous Art Gallery Guide & Cultural Curator Robot

## Executive Summary
This PRD defines requirements for an autonomous AI-powered museum and art gallery guide built on the iRobot Create® 3 platform that navigates exhibition spaces, recognizes artworks through computer vision, and provides personalized interactive tours. The system uses multimodal AI (CLIP for artwork recognition, Whisper for voice interaction, MediaPipe for engagement detection, RAG for storytelling) to deliver engaging cultural experiences that increase visitor satisfaction by 60%+, serve 100+ visitors weekly, and provide valuable analytics for exhibition planning.

**Target Users**: Museum visitors (families, art enthusiasts, tourists, students), museum curators, gallery staff, docents, education coordinators, marketing teams

**Business Value**: Scales tour capacity without additional docent hiring; increases visitor engagement and dwell time by 40%+; provides multilingual support (10+ languages) at no additional cost; generates valuable visitor interest data for exhibition planning; creates viral marketing through unique robot experience; enables after-hours virtual tours and special events.
