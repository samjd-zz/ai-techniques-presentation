# Product Requirements Document: AI-Powered Search and Rescue Robot for Disaster Response

## Executive Summary
This PRD defines requirements for an autonomous search and rescue robot designed for post-disaster operations. The system uses advanced AI perception (MediaPipe for survivor detection, Whisper for voice localization) combined with ruggedized robotics to navigate hazardous environments, locate trapped survivors, assess structural stability, and provide real-time intelligence to first responders during the critical "golden hour" after disasters.

**Target Users**: First responders, rescue team leaders, incident commanders, disaster response coordinators, emergency management agencies, trapped survivors

**Business Value**: Reduces survivor search time by 60%+, enables reconnaissance in environments too dangerous for humans, provides 24/7 operation capability, and prevents secondary casualties by assessing structural stability before human entry into collapsed structures.
